# 8803_Project

This project analyzes Q-learning to learn the optimal policy for Zero-Sum Games involving two competitive agents. In particular, the game being considered is a Pokemon battle. Also presented is a game theoretic analysis of the decisions of both agents and the stability of the Nash Equilbrium of the game. A basic Python model of the Pok√©mon game has been developed and made available publicly.
